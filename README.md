# Challenge
**Create a Footer**:
```jsx
/* 
    - Create a new folder within the component folder for a footer.
        - Within it's proper folder, create a new component called "Footer" as a jsx.
    
    - Write a function that exports a single h6 element with a copyright.
    - Type in the current year.
    - Export the component.
    - Import the component within App.jsx
    - Mount at the bottom of the JSX being returned in App.jsx. 
        - note: it doesn't need to be fixed to the bottom of the browser page

    Bonus: Make the year dynamic so it is not hard coded and will change after this year.
*/
```

**About Me**:
```js
/* 
  - Create a new folder called aboutme within the components folder.
  - Create a new file inside the folder called AboutMe.jsx.
  - Create a <p> tag that notes where you grew up. 
    - Use variables for city and state.
  - Create an unordered list with the last 3 places you have visited. (Target, Alaska, the Kitchen, etc.)
  - Export the component.
  - Import the component into App.jsx and mount it between the Header and Footer components.
